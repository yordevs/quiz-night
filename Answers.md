   - A change in text decoration (usually an underline) upon mouse hover and keyboard focus is sufficient enough to indicate a hyperlink, as users are accustomed to seeing links underlined.
   + A change in colour upon mouse hover and keyboard focus is sufficient enough to indicate a hyperlink, even if some users have low vision, color deficiency, or page color overrides.

   - Alternative visual mouse hover effects (such as background glows, drop shadows, color changes) for navigation links can help users know that an element is clickable.

1. Keyboard users utilise the tab and shift-tab keys to navigate through interactive web page elements. Visual indication of the element with current keyboard focus, called a focus indicator, is thus useful for sighted keyboard users.

To ensure the same visual presentation is available upon both mouse hover or keyboard focus, any time `a:hover` is adjusted in CSS, `a:focus` should be too. Which of the following elements on the Yordevs website does not provide focus indication?
